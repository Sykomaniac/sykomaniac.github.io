Whilst at Edgetic I worked on the core scheduling mechanism which built upon the extender model provided by Kubernetes and made use of agents to collate key data metrics. The scheduler was written using Golang and leveraged a number of technologies such as, Redis for caching calculations, InfluxDB for storing time based metrics, low-level performance tracing libraries e.g. eBPF, cgroups and Perf for collecting performance data and other tools. Whilst working on the design and implementation of the scheduler I also built a number of bespoke tools using Python (mainly NumPy and pandas) to help analyse the collected data and build 2nd/3rd order polynomial models for power efficiency analysis. I also built a number of tools to help with research tasks, for example, I created a VM migration tool written in Python, a Golang service to generate workloads using industry standard benchmarking tools e.g. HiBench, sysbench, TeraSort and many others."

After being with Asda for a year I was asked to extend my remit (due to the excellent work I had delivered) to also include general application development (mainly ASP.NET projects). During my time at Asda I worked on a multitude of colleague focused applications, each application would follow a similar design pattern â€“ an Angular.JS Ionic application that communicated with a RESTful backend service (either ASP.NET Web API or Express.JS) which in turn communicated with a data store (either MSSQL or MongoDB). My other responsibilities with Asda included up-skilling colleagues in the use of CI/CD tooling (mainly Git, Jenkins, Ansible and OneOps), advocating and driving adoption of SCRUM and Lean principles and practices, recruiting new team members and tutoring junior members in the team. Whilst at Asda I also joined the Colleague Voice team to try and improve engagement between the Asda business and development teams."

      details = "During my time at X-Lab I graduated from junior developer to senior developer over a 6 year period. My main responsibility required me to work on a national solution for use by the NHS to transfer test requests and results between pathology labs utilising different LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System). A particular highlight of my time at X-Lab required me to design, prototype and build a replacement for the Microsoft BizTalk integration engine. To achieve this we built upon the ESB pattern, developing a number of bespoke components in C# and Apache Camel. My day to day activities included developing, supporting and maintaining a large ASP.NET MVC codebase, defining, implementing and enhancing working practices - ranging from the introduction of Git, adopting Team City and Octopus Deploy for CI/CD, implementing SCRUM, assisting in sales meetings, recruiting new team members, line managing other developers and tutoring junior members of the team. Whilst at X-Lab I also worked on a number of other systems such as Patient Pathway Manager (a Backbone.js SPA for use in Leeds Teaching Hospital wards to display patient information) and ScreenTalk (a multi locale ASP.NET MVC app to help women from ethnically diverse backgrounds better understand cervical cancer screening)."
