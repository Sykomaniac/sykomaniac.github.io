# A Quick Status Update

I know it's been a long time since my last blog post aimed at providing Java users with an up-to-date guide on building GraphQL API's with SpringBoot (if you missed it check it out [here]({{< ref "/posts/20190531_GraphQL" >}}) - shameless plug :) ).

Anyway, this is just a quick status update to say that I'm still alive! 

Work has been hectic recently as I've been asked to undertake a rather large project. As the project isn't released to the public yet I won't go into the detail (although I will write a blog post once it's released!) As this has been taking up a lot of my time I have neglected to write any of my series of follow-on guides.

As a sneak peak (although I'm not sure when it will be ready) I can say that my next article focuses on producing a Flutter app that interacts with the previously built GraphQL API. This was of particular interest to me as our current JavaScript framework of choice is React/React Native. Hopefully I'll get around to writing it soon...

Until then feel free to contact me using any of the mechanisms listed on this site!
