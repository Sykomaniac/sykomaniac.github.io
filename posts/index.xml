      <description>A Quick Status Update I know it&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since my last blog post aimed at providing Java users with an up-to-date guide on building GraphQL API&amp;rsquo;s with SpringBoot (if you missed it check it out here - shameless plug :) ).
Anyway, this is just a quick status update to say that I&amp;rsquo;m still alive!
Work has been hectic recently as I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked to undertake a rather large project.</description>

      <description>GraphQL, MongoDB and Java: An introduction  TLDR; Follow the guide below if you are interested in an up to date walkthrough on how to integrate GraphQL, MongoDB and Java - if not head over to my GitHub to view the code.
